# BusMall User Stories

### Marketing Research Team
As the marketing research team, we want the data collected for each "vote" page (which product "won" the vote), but we're also concerned with the total votes for each product as well as the percentage of views for each product that elicited a vote. We also want to make sure that the user isn't given a sneak peek of the results until the time is right.

### Developer
As a developer, I want to use object oriented programming to build this app so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.

### Designer
As the designer, I want to be sure that the user experience and the aesthetic lead to a higher rate of interaction with our users. We want to present the objects in a clean and concise way, and the instructions for the process should be clearly stated so as to avoid confusion.

### Focus Group User
As a focus group user, I want to know the purpose of the exercise ahead of time and want to interact with a clean and easy-to-use app. I'd also like to know the result of my input at the end.
